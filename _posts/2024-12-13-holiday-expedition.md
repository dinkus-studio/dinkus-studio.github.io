---

We planned this trip to try and find some snow before Christmas! Impressively, all we found was a torrential downpour in Saint Louis. Even though our main goal was to find snow, we were still able to find some interesting units!

## First stop: Ozark National Scenic Riverways
---
On our way into Saint Louis, we made our first day and first stop centered around the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. This appeared to be a large land reserve with rivers, hiking, and some camping. There also appeared to be loads of entrances with different types of activities. Impressively, for how large the plot of land is, either we found the most boring entrance or all of them are boring. We went in the Big Spring entrance and there was near nothing to do. There was a large open park with the river hugging the edge. The only items in the park were a few pavilions and a few picnic tables. There were a few cabins under construction on a hill overlooking the river and park. Outside of that there was little else to do. We assumed that the summer would bring more activities to the park. Yet, we weren't impressed with the winter offerings.

## Second stop: Gateway Arch National Park
---
We stayed the night in Saint Louis and the day after our Ozark trip we went to the Gateway Arch National Park. This was our rainy day adventure. It was pouring rain and windy as could be. We had to walk to the Arch, but once there it was worth the trek. The Arch is has a large history exhibit underneath it. The exhibit details the history of the different towns that spotted up along the Mississippi River and the Arch's construction itself. You can also travel to the top of the Arch via an elevator the goes kind of sidways. Once at the top you lean out over the edge of the Arch and look directly below you and see the city. The other side will let you see the river. The view is incredible. If you haven't been to the Arch and are in Saint Louis you have to go.

## Third stop: Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site
---
Right after the Arch, we headed right to the Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site. Originally we were unsure of how this one was going to go. Presidential history isn't our strong suit, which turned out to be a great surprise for us. The site itself has three buildings. The Visitor Center, the Museum, and then the Presidential Home. The museum detailed all of the presidents early life, military career, presidential career, and then his legacy all in a barn styled building! The home was a decent sized, clearly civil war era home. It was an amazing experience as we learned about a president who seemed to be one of the few decent ones. The museum painted a great picture of a complicated man who struggled with extremely human issues during his time in office. If you don't know much about Grant, I would highly recommend this site.

## Fourth stop: Ste. Genevieve National Historic Park
---
The final day of our trip we went to the Ste. Genevieve National Historic Park. This was a small park unit with only a handful of buildings from back when the French populated the town. They are spread out over a decent sized walking path through the current small town. We walked the town fine with minimal issues traveling. The sites are interesting but not worth the trip if you are far away. After the first few buildings you have seen most that there is to offer.
