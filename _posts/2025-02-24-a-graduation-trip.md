What a loop! This trip took us to 7 different units in 4 different states and over 1600 miles! Not sure if this still counts as a mini, but 
it certainly was a trip. This one took a lot out of us as we made did this whole thing in only 4 days. Maybe next time we will think about stretching it out a few more days!

## First stop: Chickasaw National Recreation Area (8)
---
Chickasaw was a pretty nice unit with a decent amount of hiking trails and some interesting nature exhibits! The visitors center contained the nature exhibits on the local flora, fauna, and animals. They had a pretty cool bee exhibit with live bees that have a hive that extends from outside to inside the building. The hiking trails were pretty and snake back and forth by a creek with a few waterfalls and ending in a feature resevoir. There were also apparently some buffalo rancin somewhere on the unit, but we did not find them. Probably not a spot we will go back to, but a nice nature centered stop to start off the trip.

## Second stop: Waco Mammoth National Monument (8)
---
The Waco Mammoth unit was small, short, and still a cool experience. This was mainly due to the only real thing to do being seeing a live dig site. We had never seen something like this before so it will be remembered, but not for much else. There are skeletons in the dig site and well done murals on the walls, but really not much else. Certainly a good stop if you are passing by, but not something we would recommend seeking out. 

## Third stop: San Antonio Missions National Historical Park (8)
---
The missions were an interesting time period to travel back to. This unit captures the history of the missions and gives a good overview of the period. On site there is a single large strucuture of the main mission in San Antonio, the more famous one being the Alamo, and appears well preserved. There is a decently laid out and documented self-guided tour you can follow via the NPS app, and a decent amount of items to look at to get the full picutre of how autonomous these missions needed to be to survive. There is obviously a church as the central building which was fun to walk through. Yet, there isn't much there besides the mission itself. Which means we likely wouldn't go back to this unit. The site itself is nice to look at if you are in the area, but there are more interesting sites to see in San Antonio. Plus, the Alamo's exhibits give a better history lesson on the missons themselves with cooler sites and exhibits.

## Fourth stop: Brown V. Board of Education National Historic Site (7)
---
This unit is an old school building which captures racial segregation in schools physically for the modern period. It is hard to image the lengths America's ancestors went simply reading a textbook. When you can physically enter a building built with segergation in mind it paints a much better picture of America's dark past. There are class rooms laid out exactly as they were when the school was operating, and others are filled with blurbs and exhibits explaining the history of the school, the de-segergation movement, and the main events leading up and following Brown V. Board. We think this is a must see park, but not one that we will be going back to. It is laid out well, captures events well, and has everything in a format that is applicable being that it is itself a school building.  

## Fifth stop: Harry S. Truman National Historic Site (10)
---
Similar to our experience with the [Bill Clinton site](https://dinkus-studio.github.io/posts/completing-arkansas/#second-stop-president-william-jefferson-clinton-birthplace-home-national-historic-site), this presidential house was also very underwhelming. The vistors center is a hole in the wall, and the house itself is about 7 blocks away from the visitors center. The house itself is nice, but you cannot get closer than the fence line unless you wait for one of the official tours. The unit itself is pretty bad. We did see larger meusem that wasn't a part of the unit that we didn't go to. It looked much cooler on google images than the house or the visitor center.

## Sixth stop: Tall Grass Prairie National Preserve (5)
---
Wide open fields, blowing winds, and plenty of grass as far as you can see. This national preserve was an experience that we encourage everyone to seek out. On the site there is a large barn/processing building and the home of the family that ran the barn and prairie. The barn is a fun and has plenty of history pieces and exhibits showing what the barn was used for and how it funcitoned. There are also a plenty of fun interactive exhibits like lassoing a fake cow. 

The house itself can be fully traversed and it super interesting. It many rooms that all appeared original to the 1800s. It fully exported us back to life on the Prairie, and being at the frontier. 

Outside of these two structures, there are many hiking trails that cover loads of ground. Many leading to overlooks to buffalo pastures! 

This was a must see and an amazing journey to end here.
