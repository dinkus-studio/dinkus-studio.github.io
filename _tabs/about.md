# Our Travel Story

Welcome to our blog!

We are a couple who loves to travel, play games, and create things together. We are passionate about exploring the world and sharing our experiences with others! We are not experts in the field, nor should you expect to find impressive or nuanced options here. We are just two people who wanted to have a place to journal our adventures and share our thoughts on the different places we go!


# Who are we

#### Cas

Hello! 
Iâ€™m Cas. I love to express myself by being creative. I like to paint, sew and play video games and playing with my dogs. I enjoy exploring a variety of hobbies, constantly seeking out new experiences and challenges. I believe life is all about creativity and discovery! 

#### Cayub

Hey!

My name is Cayub. I am a tech enthusiast, a gamer, and I guess now I am a blogger. I enjoy tinkering with anything that computes. Which typically means the internet at the house is always down and my devices are always broken. The good thing about all of that is that I should be spending more time outside in the sun. But that is scary so I don't do that. The only time I go outside is when we travel. The whole time I have to have my safety helmet on so that I feel safe.


# Why we are doing this

On one of our trips, we visited one of the US National Park System's units out of curiosity. We discovered that all of the units in the National Park System have stamps that you can collect. Moreover, they have these interesting 'stamp collecting' books to mark which units you have gone to. We thought this was a cool idea for motivating more travel and helping our indecisive-selves pick where to go. 

Once we publicly committed to going to all 429 units in our stamp book to our friends and family, they started asking questions about the different parks and reserves we had gone to. Instead of attempting to memorize all of the units we had gone to and which were the best, we thought it was a good idea to journal them somewhere. Then, the not so obvious next step is to make a travel blog.


# Get in Touch

We don't have social media accounts. We may in the future if people actually like the stuff here. But no promises.
